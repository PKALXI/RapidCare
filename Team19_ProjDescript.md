# Team19 Project Description

- **supervisor**: Dr. Sharonna Greenberg, greenbsh@mcmaster.ca

- **project title**: Student Evaluation Analyzer

- **detailed description**: Student evaluations of teaching (SET) is central to teaching and learning.
The recent McMaster University Faculty Association (MUFA) report (Grignon et
al., 2019) found that current SET methods are biased, with low participation rates
and poor validity. Moreover, students and instructors doubt whether feedback is
used. The report therefore recommends formative and qualitative student feedback
along with accountability.
Collecting and analyzing mid-semester qualitative feedback from students can ad-
dress these recommendations: instructors would gain insights and students would
feel their voices are heard. However, equity-deserving instructors (e.g., women and
racialized groups) may be reluctant to read student feedback due to inherent bias.
Moreover, this is a labour-intensive process for which many instructors have minimal
training and capacity.
The supervisor's team has built a toolkit to analyze qualitative SET data in a scalable, effi-
cient manner, using techniques in data science including natural language process-
ing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). The next step is extending the toolkit across
the university.
The capstone software engineering or computer science students working on this
project would design an app for instructors to use the toolkit and gain insights from
midterm student evaluations of teaching.
This project is highly collaborative. Students working on this project will interact
with various stakeholders, including:
• Instructors, who are our primary users
• Data scientists, who will continue designing and refining the toolkit
• Educational research experts, who are responsible for examining instructors’
views on SET
• Administrators, who are looking to improve the culture surrounding SET.
