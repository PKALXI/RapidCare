\section{Executive Summary}

\subsection{Overview}

The usability testing for RapidCare involved 8 healthcare professionals with diverse professional roles from McMaster Children's Hospital. Participants were engaged in answering 7 different questions about different features of the system and its compatibility with the hardware. Testing was done to get insights on the following approach:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Quantitative analysis:} This approach focuses on measuring objective, performance-based data to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the RapidCare system. Additionally, we collected subjective quantitative data through rating scales to measure user satisfaction, ease of use and other relevant factors. They were further analyzed statistically to identify any possible trends.
    \item \textbf{Qualitative analysis:} This approach focuses on gathering subjective feedback by identifying any possible areas of improvements in RapidCare. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Key Findings}

The survey responses were a mix of strengths and challenges.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Strengths:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 50\% participants are perfectly satisfied with the diagnosis and treatment plan feature of RapidCare whereas  3/8 participants rated this feature as 4 on a 5.0 scale.
        \item 6/8 participants are mostly satisfied with the AI-assist feature of the system.
        \item 87.5\% of participants think that RapidCare satisfy all the needs of the user.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Challenges:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Multi-language support:} One of the participants suggested that the system should have the capabiity to support multiple languages so that it can be used in the areas where English is not the first language.
        \item \textbf{Needs not fully satisfied:} 12.5\% of participants think their needs are not fully satisfied by the system. They suggested to expand on other tabs such as blood work, labs etc..
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Participant Demographics}

This usability testing involved 8 healthcare professionals from McMaster Children's Hospital. These involve our supervisor, Dr. Kristen Burrows, and her colleagues with diverse range of roles and experience. To elaborate, participants included a mix of physicians, nurses, specialists etc. The experience levels range from early-career professionals to extensive clinical experience. The diversity among the participants is important as it strengthens the validity and generalizability of the system's performance.      

\subsection{Testing Environment}

The usability testing for the RapidCare system was conducted in a controlled environment designed to simulate typical healthcare settings while maintaining consistency across participants. This environment was chosen to minimize external distractions and ensure focused interaction with the system. It was conducted on MacBooks and devices using Windows as operating system. This variety aimed to replicate the diverse hardware landscape found within a hospital environment, ensuring the system's robustness across different platforms. Furthermore, the participants were asked if RapidCare is compatible with the hardware they are testing on. The network conditions were kept relatively stable, but some tests were performed that simulated poor network conditions, to ensure that the system could still function in areas of the hospital with poor wifi.

\subsection{Task Instructions}

The participants were instructed to perform the instructions below to test the system.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Participants were asked to login the system using valid and invalid credentials.
    \item The healthcare professional was asked to add a new patient record and testing the transcription and classification services with a mock patient. Additionally, they also verified the diagnosis and treatment plan that was predicted by the system.
    \item Then, they used AI-assist to fetch the symptoms of the mock patient.
    \item Finally, on the admin side, they were asked to add a new hospital inside the healthcare network and make sure that UI displays what they want to see.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Data Collection Methods}

\section{Recommendations}

The participants recommended different actions to further improve the software. The recommendations are listed below:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item To improve performance, the software could benefit from personalized context awareness, better multimodal interactions (text, images, audio), and real-time collaboration features. Additionally, integrating external tools, enhancing security, and enabling offline capabilities would further enhance its versatility and user experience.
    \item Creating custom templates for patients charts, integration with other systems, transferring files to other platforms functionalities could further improve the performance.
    \item May be a tutorial to guide through the system when user first uses the system as existing systems have a high learning curve.
    \item Add disclaimers when suggesting diagnosis and plan. Expand to add other tabs in existing systems like blood work, prescriptions, referrals.
    \item Multi-language support.
    \item The AI handle could be further modified for specific cases.
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Changes Implemented}

As a part of already implemented changes, the following changes are already/will be implemented.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Based on the preliminary testing that we did with our supervisor after Rev 0 demo, the feedback we got was to create an AI functionality to assist in fetching patient data for the healthcare professional without manually reviewing the patient record.
    \item Another change that we will implement as a part of next steps is adding disclaimers in UI when the diagnosis and treatment plans will be predicted by the system.
    \item We will also make a user manual to assist first-time users who will be using this system.
\end{enumerate}

All the other suggestions from the feedback are noted and will be worked upon as a part of next steps.
