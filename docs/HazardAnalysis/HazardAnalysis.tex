\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive hazard analysis for RapidCare, a software application that aims to streamline the healthcare documentation process. According to Nancy Leveson, hazard is a property/condition within the system and its environment that can cause harm or result in loss [1]. To ensure the safety of the system as well as the user, it is critical to identify and mitigate potential hazards.

For the purposes of this document, we will use the Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA) method for hazard analysis. This document will provide an overview of the scope and purpose of hazard analysis, system boundaries and components, critical assumptions about the system and its environment, and an FMEA table listing the causes and effects of failure along with recommended actions. The document will also list any additional safety and security requirements identified as a result of hazard analysis and a roadmap for implementation.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

Hazards can arise from various sources such as user input, security issues, system failure or other external factors where the system is deployed. The scope of this document is a hazard within the various system components as well as the environment in which the system will operate.

The purpose of hazard analysis is to proactively identify all potential hazards, the effects and causes of the failure and to develop appropriate mitigation strategies. Since the system will operate in a healthcare setting, it is critical to identify potential hazards. This will ensure the safety, reliability, and security of the system. Moreover, it is essential to protect sensitive information, delays in treatment, other medical errors, and the safety of the system and user. 

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

To identify potential hazards, we first define the system boundaries and break it down into its major components:

\begin{itemize}
 
    \item \textbf{User Interface:}
    The user interface is the point of interaction between the users and the system. It is responsible for displaying outputs from the system, such as patient data, medication suggestions, diagnosis predictions etc. The UI plays a crucial role in ensuring a user-friendly and intuitive experience for the users.
    
    Potential Hazards:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Incorrect user input
        \item Inadequate feedback when errors occur
        \item Incorrect data displayed to the user
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Data Layer:}
    The data layer in the system is responsible for managing and processing all data related to patient records, healthcare professionals and health networks. This database stores patient records, healthcare professionals, and healthcare network profiles.

    Potential Hazards:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Accidental deletion of database entries or the entire database
        \item Creation of duplicate records
        \item Security breaches
        \item Database crashes   
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{User Authentication:}
    This component is responsible for verifying and validating the user credentials so that unauthorized users cannot access any system data or functions. 
    
    Potential Hazards:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item User cannot log in to the system
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Account Management:}
    This component oversees user account lifecycles within the system. It handles account creation, profile updates, and account deletion, ensuring data integrity throughout these processes.
    
    Potential Hazards:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Account cannot be created, updated, or deleted
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Transcription Module:}
    The transcription module is responsible for converting audio data from the conversation to text. The converted text is used thereafter used by the report generation module to generate the report of the patient.

    Potential Hazards:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Incorrect transcription from audio to text
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Classification Module:}
    The classification module is responsible for extracting the key information from the transcription (such as symptoms, reason for visit, allergies, current medications, etc..) and automatically fill out the patient health document.

    Potential Hazards:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Incorrect classification from text to document
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Prediction Modules:}
    This module is responsible for all of the predictions that will occur based on the medical notes.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item PR1: Diagnosis Prediction: The prediction module is responsible for using the clinical notes to provide some diagnosis predictions. The goal of this module is to associate symptoms with common diagnoses. This allows for a lateral view of possible patient diagnoses.
        \item PR2: Plan Prediction: The prediction module is responsible for using the clinical notes to provide some treatment plan predictions.
        \item PR3: AI assist: If the healthcare professional wants to review patient previous visits and health conditions, it can be done by running a query in AI assist which will fetch the requested information from the system.  
    \end{itemize}
    
    Potential Hazards:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Wrong diagnosis family is predicted
        \item Processing non-medical related inputs
    \end{itemize}
    
\end{itemize}


\section{Critical Assumptions}

The following assumptions are made regarding both the software and hardware components of the system:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stable Network Connection:} It is assumed that the network connection between the client and server will be stable. If the connection is unstable, it could cause interruptions to the process, which results in significant issues in the system's performance.
        
    \item \textbf{Reliable Hardware:} It is assumed that there won't be any major hardware failures. Although hardware problems are rare, they could severely affect system availability and accuracy, especially in critical healthcare environment.

    \item \textbf{Well Intentioned Inputs:} We will assume that the user will enter input with good intention and will not be attempting to break the system or overload the system with the requests.
    
    \item \textbf{User Expertise:} We will assume that users possess the domain expertise, such as medical terminologies, which is required to effecitvely interact with the system and validating the report generated by the software.
\end{itemize}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\subsection{Access Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [AC\refstepcounter{acnum}\theacnum \label{AC_Authentication}:] The system must allow only authenticated users access to system resources.\\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Authentication is fundamental to system security as it ensures that only verified users can access sensitive resources. Logging failed attempts is crucial for detecting potential security breaches.
    \item [AC\refstepcounter{acnum}\theacnum \label{AC_AuthorizedPersonnel}:] Only authorized personnel can create, update, or delete user accounts.\\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Restricting user management operations to authorized personnel prevents unauthorized account creation and modification, which could lead to security breaches.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Integrity Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [IR\refstepcounter{irnum}\theirnum \label{IR_Autentication}:] User credentials must remain intact during authentication. Failed login attempts should not affect the system's functionality or stored data.\\
    \textbf{Rationale:} Maintaining the integrity of user credentials during authentication is essential to prevent unauthorized access and data corruption. The system must remain stable and secure regardless of authentication failures to ensure continuous service availability and protect stored credentials from potential tampering or corruption.

    \item [IR\refstepcounter{irnum}\theirnum \label{IR_ErrorDetection}:] The system should provide real-time error detection based on validation checks and provide feedback to users.\\
    \textbf{Rationale:}To prevent user errors and incorrect output, it is vital to check the integrity of user input. Moreover, in the event of an error, the system should communicate its current state, how the input has been interpreted, and any related errors to the user.

    \item [IR\refstepcounter{irnum}\theirnum \label{IR_ValidationScore}:] The system should provide confidence scores on any prediction. Additionally, after each model training session, the validation accuracy score must be outputted.\\
    \textbf{Rationale:} To understand the bias in any data and in the model. Using validation scores for training and test sets, the model can be evaluated to detect underfitting and overfitting. Additionally, adding model confidence scores will allow healthcare professionals to see how confident the model is with the scores.
    
    \item [IR\refstepcounter{irnum}\theirnum \label{IR_DuplicateRecordDetection}:] The system should provide duplicate record detection for the record in various databases of the system.\\
    \textbf{Rationale:} To prevent confusion and medical errors resulting from duplicate entries, the system should validate and flag potential duplicate records before they are created.

    \item [IR\refstepcounter{irnum}\theirnum \label{IR_BackNoiseFilter}:] The system should be able to filter the background noise to produce accuracy transcribed data.\\
    \textbf{Rationale:} It is essential to produce accurate data to avoid any inaccurate records, potential medical errors and incorrect diagnosis.

% \wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
% Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}

After the hazard analysis we identified a lot of new safety and security requirements. In terms of the scope of the capstone project, in terms of these requirements the team will aim to deliver all of the mentioned requirements in this document including the mentioned access and integrity requirements. To add in our feedback we will first prioritize critical components and incrementally integrate changes by assigning the tickets to the respective developers. The roadmap will re-assessed towards the end of the project to see if features can be augmented to complete the requirements.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable?\\
    This document has let us build more on the critical hazards and mitigation strategies to overcome them. While going through the outline of this document, we were able to provide the system components as well as their failure modes of the system. 
    
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did you resolve them?\\
    Every team project has challenges that must be solved in order to move forward successfully. We had to create a donation plan to guarantee smooth operations. To ensure that all of our plans are in line with the system, we need to plan the system components that complement our project. In order to contribute to the document and evaluate each other's work as effectively as possible, we also needed to set up a schedule.

    \item Which of your listed risks had your team thought of before this deliverable, and which did you think of while doing this deliverable? For the latter ones (ones you thought of while doing the Hazard Analysis), how did they come about?\\
    Our team had some knowledge of the system's components and possible software hazards prior to this deliverable. However, we also came up with some safety requirements, including integrity requirements, while working on this deliverable. Integrity requirements have listed a lot of detection modules that are essential for authentication purposes.
    
    \item Other than the risk of physical harm (some projects may not have any appreciable risks of this form), list at least 2 other types of risk in software products. Why are they important to consider?\\
    The other two categories of risks are security risks, like cyber-attacks, and functional risks, like performance problems. They are crucial since a malfunctioning system could cause the automation process to be delayed, which would defeat the goal of the project. Additionally, phishing and hacking may result in the loss of patient data, which would affect data privacy.
