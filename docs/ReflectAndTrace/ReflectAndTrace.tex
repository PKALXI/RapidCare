\maketitle

% \plt{Reflection is an important component of getting the full benefits from a
% learning experience.  Besides the intrinsic benefits of reflection, this
% document will be used to help the TAs grade how well your team responded to
% feedback.  Therefore, traceability between Revision 0 and Revision 1 is and
% important part of the reflection exercise.  In addition, several CEAB (Canadian
% Engineering Accreditation Board) Learning Outcomes (LOs) will be assessed based
% on your reflections.}

\section{Changes in Response to Feedback}

% \plt{Summarize the changes made over the course of the project in response to
% feedback from TAs, the instructor, teammates, other teams, the project
% supervisor (if present), and from user testers.}

% \plt{For those teams with an external supervisor, please highlight how the feedback 
% from the supervisor shaped your project.  In particular, you should highlight the 
% supervisor's response to your Rev 0 demonstration to them.}

% \plt{Version control can make the summary relatively easy, if you used issues
% and meaningful commits.  If you feedback is in an issue, and you responded in
% the issue tracker, you can point to the issue as part of explaining your
% changes.  If addressing the issue required changes to code or documentation, you
% can point to the specific commit that made the changes.  Although the links are
% helpful for the details, you should include a label for each item of feedback so
% that the reader has an idea of what each item is about without the need to click
% on everything to find out.}

% \plt{If you were not organized with your commits, traceability between feedback
% and commits will not be feasible to capture after the fact.  You will instead
% need to spend time writing down a summary of the changes made in response to
% each item of feedback.}

% \plt{You should address EVERY item of feedback.  A table or itemized list is
% recommended.  You should record every item of feedback, along with the source of
% that feedback and the change you made in response to that feedback.  The
% response can be a change to your documentation, code, or development process.
% The response can also be the reason why no changes were made in response to the
% feedback.  To make this information manageable, you will record the feedback and
% response separately for each deliverable in the sections that follow.}

% \plt{If the feedback is general or incomplete, the TA (or instructor) will not
% be able to grade your response to feedback.  In that case your grade on this
% document, and likely the Revision 1 versions of the other documents will be
% low.} 

This section summarizes the changes we have made in regards to the feedback we got from TAs, supervisor, peer review, supervisor, and during usability testing. 
The changes made can be found in the below able by clicking on associated issues. 
In order to ease the traceability we have categorized the issue into milestones such as 'TA Feedback Issues', 'Peer Review', and 'Final Doc Updates' which can be found in \href{https://github.com/users/Inreet-Kaur/projects/2/views/1}{Team-25's Capstone Deliverables Project}. Associated PRs for issues can be viewed under specific views created for \href{https://github.com/users/Inreet-Kaur/projects/2/views/8?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=TA+Feedback+Issues}{TA feedback},  \href{https://github.com/users/Inreet-Kaur/projects/2/views/10?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=Peer+Review}{Peer review}, and \href{https://github.com/users/Inreet-Kaur/projects/2/views/9?sliceBy%5Bvalue%5D=Milestone+8+-+Final+Doc+Updates}{Final documentation updates} issues.

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\subsection{Challenge Level}

\plt{State the challenge level (advanced, general, basic) for your project.  Your challenge level should exactly match what is included in your problem statement.  This should be the challenge level agreed on between you and the course instructor.}

\subsection{Extras}

\plt{Summarize the extras (if any) that were tackled by this project.  Extras
can include usability testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal
proof, GenderMag personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Extras should have already
been approved by the course instructor as included in your problem statement.}

\section{Design Iteration (LO11 (PrototypeIterate))}

\plt{Explain how you arrived at your final design and implementation.  How did
the design evolve from the first version to the final version?} 

\plt{Don't just say what you changed, say why you changed it.  The needs of the
client should be part of the explanation.  For example, if you made changes in
response to usability testing, explain what the testing found and what changes
it led to.}

\section{Design Decisions (LO12)}

\plt{Reflect and justify your design decisions.  How did limitations,
 assumptions, and constraints influence your decisions?  Discuss each of these
 separately.}

\section{Economic Considerations (LO23)}

\plt{Is there a market for your product? What would be involved in marketing your 
product? What is your estimate of the cost to produce a version that you could 
sell?  What would you charge for your product?  How many units would you have to 
sell to make money? If your product isn't something that would be sold, like an 
open source project, how would you go about attracting users?  How many potential 
users currently exist?}

\section{Reflection on Project Management (LO24)}

\plt{This question focuses on processes and tools used for project management.}

\subsection{How Does Your Project Management Compare to Your Development Plan}

\plt{Did you follow your Development plan, with respect to the team meeting plan, 
team communication plan, team member roles and workflow plan.  Did you use the 
technology you planned on using?}

\subsection{What Went Well?}

\plt{What went well for your project management in terms of processes and 
technology?}

\subsection{What Went Wrong?}

\plt{What went wrong in terms of processes and technology?}

\subsection{What Would you Do Differently Next Time?}

\plt{What will you do differently for your next project?}

\section{Reflection on Capstone}

\plt{This question focuses on what you learned during the course of the capstone project.}

\subsection{Which Courses Were Relevant}

\plt{Which of the courses you have taken were relevant for the capstone project?}

\subsection{Knowledge/Skills Outside of Courses}

\plt{What skills/knowledge did you need to acquire for your capstone project
that was outside of the courses you took?}
