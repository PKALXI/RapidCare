\section{Code Coverage Metrics}

The image below displays the code coverage metrix. This includes all the files, includes the files for which the team created unit tests. Although some files such as firebase.ts and DatabaseOps.ts for which we have developed the unit tests demonstrate higher test coverage, the overall test coverage is lower. This is because most of the code is prewritten which is why only 55.06'\%' and 30.12'\%' of branches are covered as per the metrcs. The figure below show the code coverage metrics example for RapidCare.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable?
  This document has let us strengthen the understanding about unit testing of all functional requirements as well as verification of all non-functional qualities of the system. While going through the outline of the document, we were able to conduct unit testing and compare it with the existing implementation. It also made us better execute the detailed procedure of system testing along with performing validation and verification of the system. 

  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did you resolve them?
  There are obstacles in any team project that must be overcome for it to proceed successfully. To ensure seamless operations, we had to develop a strategy for contributions. Since we already had the list of tests that were needed to be conducted for both functional and non-functional requirements, we divided them equally among all the team members. We also needed to create a schedule to contribute to the template and review each other's work in the best way possible. 

  \item Which parts of this document stemmed from speaking to your client(s) or a proxy (e.g. your peers)? Which ones were not, and why?
  The client's feedback helped us to understand the changes due to testing the requirements. Before Rev 0 demo, the team gave a demo to the supervisor about the system pretending the supervisor as the healthcare professional using the system. The supervisor then gave us some possible ways that the healthcare professional would like to use the system. This helped us to improve some features of the system such as whether prescription of a patient is being saved or not. If yes, then is it being stored within the system or on local machine. Furthermore, the section such as unit testing of all functional requirements stemmed from the collective ideas of our peers. We discussed different test cases that each requirement could possibly have along with how they will be implemented. In this way, we got diverse test cases and all team members were able to contribute especially in this critical section of the report.

  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
  VnV Plan was little bit different from the activities that were actually conducted and recorded in VnV Report. This is because VnV Plan includes one extra functional requirement test which needs to be deleted as the team has decided to not pursue with that functional requirement. Therefore, the team will modify the VnV Plan to remove that requirement.Additionally, as part of the modifications, the team removed some Non-Functional Requirements tests to reduce redundancy, such as test-S2, test-CR2, and test-PR1, and updated the traceability to the requirements for both Non-Functional Requirements tests and Safety and Security tests. These changes were made to streamline the testing process and ensure alignment with the system's goals. This change occured as we went through every detail of our system and it turns out that functional requirement is not necessary for the system to accomplish its goal. Yes, we will be able to anticipate thus change in the future projects as going through every detail of the project review the necessary and non-necessary features of the product.
